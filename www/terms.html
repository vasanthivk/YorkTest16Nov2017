IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE APP OR, IF ALREADY DOWNLOADED, PLEASE DELETE THE APP FROM YOUR DEVICE.</b></p><p><b>Who we are</b><br>Hello! We are Advisr Technologies Ltd and operate the FoodAdvisr app. FoodAdvisr is a trade name. We are registered in England and Wales under company number 10275423 and have our registered office at Avebury House, 6 St Peter Street, Winchester, Hampshire, England, SO23 8BN.<br> <br><b>What this Agreement does</b><br>We license you to use:<br>the FoodAdvisr mobile application software together with the data supplied with the software (App) and any updates or supplements to it;<br>the related online documentation (User Information); and<br>the service you connect to via the App and the content we provide to you through it (Service) <br>as permitted in these terms.<br> <br><b>What the App does</b><br>The App offers an information matching service. It helps you to access product information to make choices that suit your needs and lifestyle. All you need to do is create a profile and start scanning the bar codes of the products you wish to buy or select the menu items you wish to compare.</p><p>Understanding your individual preferences is the key to FoodAdvisr. You can create personal profiles for yourself, just the kids or even the whole family. By building your profile, you can tell us what matters to you, whether that is the allergens you need to avoid or the ingredients to exclude from the products you buy.  </p><p>Each time you scan a product, or select a menu item, the App will immediately map the profile you’ve selected to use against the scanned or selected product’s information and let you know if this matches your preferences. Best of all, you will even be able to share profiles for a short period of time so that you can select the right choices for a friend and vice versa.  </p><p>We give you the opportunity to become a member of various Communities as detailed in the App, so that you can see and share information about your food discoveries with people that have similar needs or interests.  You do this by simply pressing the ‘Share’ button in your results page.  You also have the opportunity to add your own personal comments that will be shared with the Communities to which you belong.  Please comply with the Acceptable Use Policy available at www.foodadvisr.com when making comments.  In the event that we or another user have concerns about the comments you make, we reserve the right to remove the applicable comment(s), suspend you from accessing the Service and take any further appropriate action. Please make sure that you keep this in mind when you write your comments.  The comments you make will be posted to our website in the relevant ‘Communities’ section.</p><p><b>Where the product information comes from</b><br>We have obtained information about the products directly from industry-leading sources, such as Brand Bank, or from a named retailer or dining business where you are using the App. In some cases product labels can tell you all you need to know and we make that much easier and quicker; in other cases, the information is not easy to see and you would need to ask the staff for help. FoodAdvisr enables you to make those choices directly from your Smartphone as we have the information to help you make your informed choices.</p><p>We work with qualified nutritionists to help us to improve our service and build our pre-set profiles which you can use and/or modify instead of creating your own from scratch.</p><p><b>What the App cannot do</b><br>The App provides you with general information but it cannot offer medical advice. The product information the App offers you is for information purposes only and does not constitute nor is a substitute for professional medical advice. If you do have allergies, we ask you to please read the advisory section on Allergens below and the section on Our responsibility for loss or damage suffered by you.</p><p>We offer an information matching service and always take care to provide accurate information where possible and have worked very closely with qualified nutritionists to make sure we have captured the latest thinking.  However, we are unable to verify the information given to us. We rely upon the producers, retailers and dining businesses to give us the correct information about their products. Therefore, we cannot accept responsibility for any errors, omissions or misleading statements in the information provided by the brands and retailers.</p><p><b>Our advice on allergens</b><br>FoodAdvisr follows EU regulations and Food Standards Agency guidance on food allergens and our app is designed to identify and alert you to their presence in any product that you scan or select, based upon the data provided to us by the food producer, and the allergen settings that you save in the app.  However, if you do suffer from an allergy, you may still wish to personally evaluate the accuracy and completeness of the information provided by the App. You may wish to check product labels, if available, or further materials provided by a brand or retailer, or speak with a medical professional before purchasing, consuming and/or using any products scanned with the App. </p><p>Although we work hard to ensure that the information you receive from the App is accurate, we are unable to verify the product information. If a brand, retailer or dining business misses an allergen in the information they provide to us, we cannot identify and correct this. </p><p>In addition, please be advised that any update to product information, including an addition or change in allergen content, will be provided within 24 hours of the information being available to us. This means that we can only guarantee that the product information is up-to-date as of 24 hours previously, provided that you have updated the App when prompted. We advise you to ensure that the App is consistently updated to capture any modifications. Please also note that the App can only update when it is connected to the internet.</p><p><b>Your privacy</b><br>We only use any personal data we collect through your use of the App and the Services in the ways set out in our privacy policy. </p><p>We will use your personal data to process any requests you send us for goods or services.

Loss or damage is foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time you accepted these terms, both we and you knew it might happen.</p><p>We are not responsible for any product information. We are an information matching service and, although we work closely with qualified nutritionists we are not food, nutrition, cosmetic or medical experts or producers.

If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.<br> <br><b>Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later</b><br>Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date. </p><p><b>Alternative Dispute Resolution  </b><br>Alternative dispute resolution is a process where an independent body considers the facts of a dispute and seeks to resolve it, without you having to go to court. If you are not happy with how we have handled any complaint, you may want to contact the alternative dispute resolution provider we use. You can submit a complaint to Chartered Institute of Arbitrators via their website at www.ciarb.org. You will not be charged for making a complaint and if you are not satisfied with the outcome you can still bring legal proceedings. In addition, please note that disputes may (for as long as the United Kingdom is a member of the European Union) be submitted for online resolution to the European Commission Online Dispute Resolution platform.</p><p><b>Law and jurisdiction</b><br>These terms are governed by English law and you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the App, the User Information and the Service in the English courts.
